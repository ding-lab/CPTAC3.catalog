BamMaps for both storage1 and katmai have a number of issues:

* some blank values for sample_type field (col 5)
* katmai.BamMap.dat has some aliquot names in sample_type field
* system field (col 11) has "docker" as a value in some cases
* Duplicate entries
    * same data path occurring twice
    * example: 9fbbc31e-053a-4d23-8a67-2fdff79e1141
* Duplicate downloads
    * Same UUID, differnet path
    * this indicates wasted disk space
    * example: 9fbbc31e-053a-4d23-8a67-2fdff79e1141
