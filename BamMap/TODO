BamMap for katmai has a number of issues:

* Duplicate downloads
    * Same UUID, differnet path
    * this indicates wasted disk space
    * example: 9fbbc31e-053a-4d23-8a67-2fdff79e1141
    * 107 files, 1847.33 Gb

Do duplicate analysis for MGI too.

Additional development - BamMap.fsck
* scan BamMap for deviations from Catalog file
    * Look for deprectated data vs. Catalog file
* look for duplicates entries, identify whether these constitute double download
    * Should add duplicate download check at Import time
